# 🔐 Insufficient Security Configurability: No Password Policy 🚫🔑

## 🧠 Summary

The application does not enforce any password complexity or strength policy. This allows users to set weak passwords like `123456`, `password`, or even single-character strings. The lack of enforcement makes the application highly susceptible to **credential stuffing**, **brute-force**, and **dictionary attacks**.

---

## ⚠️ Impact

- ✅ Weak passwords can be easily guessed or cracked.
- 🚨 Increases risk of account takeover.
- 🔓 Reduces the overall security posture of the application.
- 👥 Users are not guided to create strong, secure credentials.

---

## 🧪 Reproduction Steps

1. 🔐 Register a new account or go to **Change Password** page.
2. 🧾 Set a weak password like:
   - `password`
   - `12345678`
   - `a`
   - `abc123`
3. ✅ Observe that the application **accepts the weak password without warning or rejection**.

---

## 🔍 Expected Behavior

The application **should enforce** a strong password policy, such as:

- Minimum length (e.g., ≥ 8 characters)
- At least one uppercase letter 🔠
- At least one lowercase letter 🔡
- At least one number 🔢
- At least one special character 💥

---

## 🛠️ Recommendation

Implement a **strict password policy** in both frontend and backend, and provide real-time feedback to users. For example:

- ❌ Reject passwords like `password`, `qwerty`, or anything on a known breached list.
- ✅ Require passwords to meet the strength criteria.
- 💬 Display strength meter and helpful suggestions.

Example (Regex-based) enforcement:

```regex
^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[^A-Za-z0-9])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$
