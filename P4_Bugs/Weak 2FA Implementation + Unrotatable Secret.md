# 🔐💥 Weak 2FA Implementation + Unrotatable Secret = Permanent Bypass Risk 🔓

## 🧠 Summary

💡 **Vulnerability**: The application does not allow users to rotate their TOTP secret after 2FA is enabled — even during re-enrollment or recovery.

🔻 Combined with:
- ⚠️ **Insufficient Security Configurability**
- 🧨 **Weak 2FA Implementation**
- 🔒 **Persistent TOTP Secret**

➡️ This results in **permanent exposure** if the TOTP secret is ever compromised, with **no way for the user to reset/regenerate it**.

---

## 🛠️ Reproduction Steps

### ✅ 1. Register and Enable 2FA
- Sign up for a new account or use an existing one.
- Navigate to: `Settings → Security → 2FA`
- Set up 2FA using a QR code or secret key (e.g., `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP`).
- ✅ Save the secret for later comparison.

---

### 🧪 2. Try to Rotate the 2FA Secret 🔄
- Disable 2FA.
- Re-enable it.
- ⚠️ Observe whether the **same secret is reused**.

🧬 You can:
- Compare the QR code shown during re-setup
- Inspect the `otpauth://` link or the raw secret string

### ❌ 3. Confirm No Option to Rotate
- Look for missing options like:
  - ⛔ "Generate new secret"
  - ⛔ "Reset 2FA"
  - ⛔ "Rotate TOTP token"
- Or test API: `/2fa/reset`, `/2fa/rotate`, etc.

If **no such feature exists**, it's **a critical design flaw**.

## 🧾 4. Generate OTPs Using the Old Secret

Even after disable/re-enable or password change, try:

```bash
oathtool --totp -b JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP
